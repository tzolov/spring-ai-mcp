# Spring AI MCP

Java SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing seamless integration between Java and Spring applications and MCP-compliant AI models and tools.

## Overview

Spring AI MCP is an experimental project that provides Java and Spring Framework integration for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.org/docs/concepts/architecture). It enables Spring applications to interact with AI models and tools through a standardized interface, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns.

## Modules

The project consists of two main modules:

### spring-ai-mcp-core

The core module provides a Java implementation of the Model Context Protocol specification. It includes:
- Synchronous and asynchronous client implementations
- Standard MCP operations support (tool discovery, resource management, prompt handling)
- Stdio-based server transport
- Reactive programming support using Project Reactor

### spring-ai-mcp-spring

The Spring integration module provides Spring-specific functionality:
- Integration with Spring AI's function calling system
- Spring-friendly abstractions for MCP clients
- Automatic conversion between JSON and Java objects for tool arguments

## Requirements

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- Spring AI 1.0.0-M4 or later

## Installation

Add the following dependencies to your Maven project:

```xml
<!-- For core MCP functionality -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.experimental</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-mcp-core</artifactId>
